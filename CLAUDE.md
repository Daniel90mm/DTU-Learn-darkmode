I am a student at DTU (technical university of denmark). 

I want a dark mode firefox extension that darkens the wanted pages i give.

I want not complete darkness, of course showing links, some color, like DTU red, which is a signature color which has to be there.

PDF, video players should not be darkened.

When i say very dark or dark 1, i mean rgb(26,26,26).

When i say less dark or dark 2, i mean rgb(45,45,45).

I do not understand HTML, css, javascript, no web dev stuff, so if you cant darken something i want, give me clear instructions on what to give you so you can darken it.

when i copy something from the "inspect element" page, i will copy the html code with "Copy Outer HTML".

No emojis unless asked for
