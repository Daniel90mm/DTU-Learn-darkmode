# Privacy Policy - DTU After Dark

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Data Collection

DTU After Dark does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal user data. The extension operates entirely locally in your browser.

## What the Extension Does

- Injects CSS styles and JavaScript into DTU-related web pages to apply a dark color theme and additional features.
- All user preferences (dark mode toggle, bus configuration, GPA simulator data) are stored locally in your browser using localStorage and browser.storage.
- No data leaves your device except as described under Third-Party Services below.

## Permissions

The extension requires access to the following domains to apply styling and features:

- `learn.inside.dtu.dk` - DTU Learn (Brightspace LMS)
- `s.brightspace.com` - Brightspace static assets (iframes)
- `sts.ait.dtu.dk` - DTU login page
- `evaluering.dtu.dk` - DTU course evaluations
- `studieplan.dtu.dk` - DTU study planner
- `kurser.dtu.dk` - DTU course catalog
- `karakterer.dtu.dk` - DTU grades
- `sites.dtu.dk` - DTU department sites
- `campusnet.dtu.dk` - CampusNet grades

No personal data from these sites is read, stored, or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

The extension communicates with the **Rejseplanen API** (`www.rejseplanen.dk`) to fetch public transit departure times for DTU-area bus stops. These requests contain only stop IDs — no user-identifying information is sent.
